  <p id="title">HTML & CSS: Exercise 01</p>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <p>This page shows an example of very basic HTML with CSS applied to it. For this exercise, you will create:<br>
 <ol>
  <li>New text for your main document</li>
  <li>New p id's (6)</li>
  <li>New CSS for these p id's</li>
   <li>New text in your table</li>
   <li>New CSS for your table</li>
</ol>
The Helpful Tools on Canvas can be of assistance in knowing what the selectors, properties, and values mean. There are also tools for selecting your colors.<p>
  
Once you've completed these steps, you will submit the link to your CodePen and a copy of your complete .html document to Canvas.

   <p id="title">Let's Do This!</p>
<p id="para1">This is a green, centered paragraph with 20px text.</p>
  <!—It ain't easy being green. -->
<p id="para2">This is another green, centered paragraph, but with regular text.</p>
<p id="para3">Too much center. Too much green! <br>
  This paragraph goes right and turns into a tomato.</p>
<p id="para4">Too much right. Too much bright! This dim gray paragraph goes left.</p>
<p id="para5">This paragraph is on the right side and purple.</p>
  <p>
<p id="para6">This paragraph looks however you want.</p>
  <h2>A Table!</h2>
  <!—There are times when you may want to use the div instead of creating a table. Tables are the standard for tabular data, while div is used to define objects on the page and page layout. -->
  <p id="para4">Example 1. A Very Simple Table</p>
  <table id="jokebooks">
  <tr>
    <th>Title</th>
    <th>Author</th>
    <th>Key Idea</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Big Bad Wolf</td>
    <td>A. Pig</td>
    <td>Build your home from bricks, not straw or sticks.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Carrots and Cabbage</td>
    <td>P. Cottontail</td>
    <td>Some farmers are mean. Some rabbits are naughty.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So Hungry</td>
    <td>H. Caterpillar</td>
    <td>A lot of energy is required to become a butterfly.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <!—I could also add notes in the comments. This is pretty common. -->
  Normally, a markup document would appear with the !DOCTYPE at the start of a document, followed by the head, which contains the style, and then the body. CodePen automatically places the HTML first. That means if you want to create a complete .html document from what you've written here, you'll want to copy over the CSS first, followed by the HTML. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ef-LHdB6wwE9RyhcXHVQ251g2xjShC4i5ZRTH8Pv_iY/edit?usp=sharing">Here's what my example pages looks like as an HTML document. </a> (Make sure to open this in a new tab - it's won't load in CodePen.) You can download it and open it in your browser.<p>
  CSS can also exist on its own and you can reference the file. This is called an "external style sheet." If you save a .css file, remove the HTML -- you will only want the CSS to be applied to the pages where you're using it.
  <!—Who's awesome? You're awesome. Look at that beautiful page you made! -->
